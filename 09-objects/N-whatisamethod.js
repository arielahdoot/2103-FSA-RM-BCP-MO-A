// so what is a method?

/* 
Methods are actions you can perform on a value 
*/

/* 
We've been using methods throughout this course, like .indexOf 
*/

/* these methods are built into JS; we don't have to define them ourselves */

let countries = ['Argentina', 'Bolivia', 'Brazil', 'Chile'];
console.log(countries.indexOf('Brazil'));
