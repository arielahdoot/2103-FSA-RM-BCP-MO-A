// Why are objects useful?

/* consider representing Pusheen the Cat as an array */
let pusheen = ['Pusheen', 7, 'gray and tabby'];

/* an array is a good place to hold an ordered list of values, but it doesn't store any information about what those values represent */

/* an object's string keys allows objects to store more information about the values within it */

let pusheen = {
  'name': 'Pusheen',
  'age': 7,
  'color': 'gray and tabby'
};
