// Let's talk about the benefits of using one loop over the other

/* 
Possible use cases for a for loop
----------------------------
- used often if you're iterating over a fixed length
- can be useful if you want to iterate sequentially, or in intervals, because you can set that up in the beginning
*/

/* 
Possible use cases for a while loop
----------------------------
- used often if all you want to keep track of is whether a specific condition is true
- used often when you don't know how many iterations something will take
