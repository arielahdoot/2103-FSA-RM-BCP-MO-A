/* 
recursion occurs when a function calls itself!  
*/

// recursion is an alternative to iteration (using a loop) 

/* in the real world, you may see recursion instead of iteration when a recursive solution:
     - is easier to reason about (recursion helps break big problems into small chunks)
     - is easier to read than an iterative solution
     - won't negatively affect performance too much (recursion can be a memory hog)
