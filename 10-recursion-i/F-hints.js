/*
Other Recursion Hints
---------------------
- start with the base case
- test recursive using a simple input that results in few recursive calls to the base case
- ask yourself: what type of thing (number, string, boolean, etc) should my function return? base case and recursive case should return the same type of thing!
- use console.logs or debugger or visualizer to debug
- if you get stuck on a recursive problem, try writing it iteratively, e.g. how you normally would at this point. It can reveal the inner workings of recursion to just see how you normally would do it

// todo: need to add scope aspect to this so they know that not all num parameters are the same
