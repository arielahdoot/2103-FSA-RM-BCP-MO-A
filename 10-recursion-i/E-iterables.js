/*
Recursion and Iterables
-----------------------
- you can use recursion with any data type in JS 
- if you're asked to recurse through arrays or strings, the base case often occurs when the iterable is empty or has a length of one
  - imagine finding the sum of numbers in an array 
  - sumArray([4]); // if array.length === 1, the sum is easy to calculate
- if the base case required the iterable to have a length of 1 or 0, it must mean that the recursive case has to reduce the length of the iterable with every recursive call 
- note: nested arrays can be approached differently; see next unit!
