// What is scope?

/* 
Scope refers to which variables can be accessed by your code at a specific location in your code. 
*/

let wow = 'wow';
console.log(wow);

// in this case, the console.log() call has
// access to the variable wow, because
// they are in the same scope

// we'll have a better understanding of how this works as we go on
